    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my adaptation of a traditional Paraguayan egg/onion/cheese dish.</p>
    <p>It's traditionally served at parties and other festive gatherings, but it's good any time.</p>
    <p>I'm using non-specialty ingredients available at an American supermarket.  The corn in Paraguay probably 
        isn't bred to be as sweet as American corn, and the cheese is a little different, but this still tastes
        great, even if it might not be as authentic or cooked in the same kind of oven as the real stuff.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 sweet yellow onions, diced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (half stick) butter</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>3 cans whole kernel corn (~1300g total)</li>
        <li>12 oz. (340g) queso fresco or similar cheese</li>
        <li>8 oz. low moisture shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>pepper to taste</li>
        <li>6 eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 355 degrees.</li>
        <li>In large skillet, fry onions in butter over medium heat until onions are soft and translucent.</li>
        <li>Move onions and butter to mixing bowl to cool slightly; stir in salt to distribute.</li>
        <li>Divide queso fresco into thirds; chop into cubes to facilitate blending.</li>
        <li>Drain and rinse corn one can at a time.</li>
        <li>Add to blender:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>1 can corn</li>
                <li>1/3 cup milk</li>
                <li>1/3 of the queso fresco</li>
                <li>1/3 of the cooled fried onions</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Blend until combined.  Avoid putting the egg into the onions if they are still hot.  You want the eggs
            to cook in the oven, not in the blender!</li>
        <li>Pour mixture into pan.  I have been using a 9 x 13 inch pyrex baking dish.</li>
        <li>Repeat for the rest of the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle mozzarella on top of the uncooked mixture.  Distribute through the mixture by stirring in. 
            Add pepper to paste.</li>
        <li>Bake on center rack for 1 hr 15 min - 1 hr 45 min or until water stops bubbling out and top is 
            golden brown.</li>
        <li>It will hold together better and be easier to serve if you let it cool a bit.</li>
    </ol>
