    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I love bacon, but frying it in my apartment makes a lot of smoke.</p>
    <p>This is a simple oven preparation that is relatively quick, smokeless, and easy to clean up.</p>
    <p>It's nice to have bacon that you don't have to babysit, too.  The pieces get crispier if you cut them 
        smaller.  You can pour the bacon grease off the liner and save for future recipes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bacon</li>
        <li>Parchment paper or aluminum foil (I use parchment paper)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees.</li>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with raised sides (to contain bacon grease) with foil or parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Bake on center rack for about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
